This repository contains the code that generates and runs on the [Left Goat website](https://leftgoat.com).  It's based on my [Node.js with headless WordPress CMS on Heroku](https://github.com/codyml/node-headless-wordpress) server setup.  It's a good example of the technologies and production workflows I'm using in web development as of December 2016.
